# PostGradCollab
Collaboration of graduates of devCodeCamp to design a website for post grads to collaborate and present their work and porfolios.

## News
January 14th, 
   This is our initial/base project for us to begin the backend development. It has an example usage of MongoDB interaction (please see other documentation to make sure the appsetting.json matches your localdb until we have a global shard or hosted db.). This project also incorporates Swagger to document our API. I will also try to host a seperate Swagger Editor instance for people to make changes/recommendations for the API/endpoints without needing to hardcode them.
   Tomorrow after our next meeting, I will post User Stories and any DB modeling docs or ERDs that we have general consensus on. Please feel free to fork or contact me to become a contributor. ~Tim H.
