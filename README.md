# PostGradCollab
Collaboration of graduates of devCodeCamp to design a website for post grads to collaborate and present their work and porfolios.

## News
January 19th, 
   Per consensus at last meeting, Project structure has been changed to reflect the addition/change to utilizing ReactJs.Net allowing for full MVC usage with client or server-side rendering of React Components within views (or a base SPA running off of a main controller.) Dumby examples of a Post and Post comment class have been added for John E. to continue work on post components.

## Future
   Katelynn T. will be beginning work on the Repository Design Pattern implementation, while she and others continue work on the ERD.
   Tim H. will test implementing an Authentification/Authorization schema.
